Calculating core, executers and memory:

Consider if we have 10 Node and 16 cores per Node. Each Node represents 64GB RAM.
5 core per executors.

 1.) If we want to find total number of cores:
      10 (Node) * 16 (cores per node) = 160
      
 2.) If we want to find available number of core:
      [ note: Always consider one core per Node will be assigned for OS function. In our case, we are having 10 cores. If we take a core from every node, we will have 5 remaing per Node.]
      160 (Total number of cores) - 10 (Remaining cores per node)  = 150
      
 3.) If we want to find number of core per Machine:
      150 (Available Node) / 5 (core per executors) = 30
      
      29
  
 4.)  If we want to find available executor per node:
      30 (Available core) / 10 (Node) = 3
      
 64GB/3 = 21GB
 
 Counting off heap overhead = 7% of 21GB = 3GB. So, actual --executor-memory = 21 - 3 = 18GB
