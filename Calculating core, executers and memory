Calculating core, executers and memory:

Consider if we have 10 Node(Machine) and 16 cores per Node. 5 cores per executor. Each Node represents 64GB RAM.

 1.) If we want to find total number of cores:
      10 (Node) * 16 (cores per node) = 160
      
 2.) If we want to find available number of core:
 
      [ note: Always consider one core per Node will be assigned for OS function. In our case, we are having 10 cores. 
              If we take a core from every node, we will have 5 remaing per Node.]
              
      160 (Total number of cores) - 10 (Remaining cores per node)  = 150
      
 3.) If we want to find number of executors:
      150 (Available Node) / 5 (executor core) = 30
      
      For Application Manager: 30 - 1 = 29
  
 4.) If we want to find available executor per Node:
      30 (Available executor) / 10 (executor cores) = 3
      
 5.) Avaialble memory: 64 - 1 = 63GB

 6.) Available memory per executor: 63 / 3 = 21GB
 
 7.) Counting off heap overhead = 7% of 21GB = 3GB. So, actual 
     Executor memory: 21 - 3 = 18GB
